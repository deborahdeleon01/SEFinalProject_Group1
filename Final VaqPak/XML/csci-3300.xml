<Description>
This course is designed to give students an opportunity to gain practical experience in the computer science career field by
	working with a participating employing firm or organization. The student will be supervised by a faculty member
	acting as a liaison between the University and the employing organization to ensure compliance with specific
	learning and experience requirements. The employment can be either paid or unpaid, and normally would include
	practical experience spread over one academic term or summer. May be repeated once. A maximum of three hours of
	credit from CSCI 3300 can be used toward the computer science major.
