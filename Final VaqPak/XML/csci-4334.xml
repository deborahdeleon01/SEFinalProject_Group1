      1. Explain the organization of the classical von Neumann machine and its major functional units.
      2. Describe the principles of memory management.
      3. Explain how interrupts, are used to implement I/O control and data transfers.
      4. Describe the functions of a contemporary operating system with respect to convenience, efficiency, and the ability to evolve.
      5. Discuss networked, client-server, distributed operating systems and how they differ from single user operating systems.

      16. Summarize the principles of virtual memory as applied to caching, paging, and segmentation.
      17. Evaluate the tradeoffs in terms of memory size (main memory, cache memory, auxiliary memory) and processor speed.
      18 Defend the different ways of allocating memory to tasks, citing the relative merits of each.
      19 Describe the reason for and use of cache memory.
      20 Compare and contrast paging and segmentation techniques.
