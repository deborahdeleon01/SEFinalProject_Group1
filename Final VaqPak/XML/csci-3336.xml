  <Description>
    This course describes the fundamental concepts of programming languages by discussing the design of the various language
    constructs, examining the design choices for these constructs, critically comparing design alternatives and discussing
    implementation techniques. The underlying theory and formal modes of describing the syntax and semantics including finite
    automata and regular expressions, context-free grammars, context-sensitive languages and the Chomsky Hierarchy are included.
