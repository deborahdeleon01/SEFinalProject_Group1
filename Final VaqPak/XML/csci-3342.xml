  <Description>
    Introduction to web application programming. Covers the fundamentals of developing
    applications for web browsers, within the dominant HTTP-based client/server model.
    A wide range of technologies and development methodologies are covered, including database
    and server architectures, serer-side frameworks, client-side languages/libraries, remote
    invocation models and web application security. Specific topics in web development change
    rapidly, but some examples include SQL, HTML, TLS, PHP, Java EE (servllets, JSP, etc),
    ASP.NET.
