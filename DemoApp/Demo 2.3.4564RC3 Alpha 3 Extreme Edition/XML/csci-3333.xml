  <Description>
    This course is a continuation of data structures topics covered in CSCI 2380. Content includes theoretical topics in
    algorithmic efficiency and complexity, along with abstract data types, including graphs, networks, trees, and priority
    queues. Search topics, including hashing, trees, external search trees (B-trees), and sorting algorithms including
    external sorting are introduced and compared. Computational complexity topics include the class P and NP, NP-completeness
    and reducibility, NP-completeness proofs, and NP-complete problems.
